    "summary": "GraphQL Batching Attack",
    "description": "Abuse GraphQL's query batching feature to bypass rate-limiting and perform large-scale enumeration or brute-force attacks.",
    "category": "API Security",
    "severity": "Medium",
    "testing_type": "Vulnerability Assessment",
    "target": "GraphQL endpoints",
    "instructions": "1. Identify a GraphQL endpoint.\n2. Craft a single HTTP request that contains an array of multiple, independent GraphQL queries. For example, trying to guess a 2FA code: `[{\"query\":\"query { checkCode(code:1111) }\"}, {\"query\":\"query { checkCode(code:1112) }\"}, ...]`\n3. If the server processes all queries in the batch as a single request, it bypasses rate limits enforced on a per-request basis. Document the successful batched request."
