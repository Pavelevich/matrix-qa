    "description": "Test if the server fails to issue a new CSRF token after login, allowing an attacker to fixate a token in a user's browser and reuse it.",

    "severity": "High",
    "testing_type": "Security Assessment",
    "target": "CSRF protection mechanism",
    "instructions": "1. Navigate to the login page as an unauthenticated user. If a CSRF token is already present in a form, capture its value.\n2. Log in to the application.\n3. After logging in, check the CSRF token on a protected form again. If it's the *same token* as the one from before you logged in, the application is vulnerable to token fixation.\n4. An attacker can feed a valid but unauthenticated token to a victim's browser, and after the victim logs in, the attacker can use that known token to perform actions."
