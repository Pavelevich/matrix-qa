    "summary": "OAuth 2.0 CSRF Attack",
    "description": "Exploit a lack of a 'state' parameter in an OAuth 2.0 flow to trick a user into logging into the attacker's account.",
    "category": "Authentication Bypass",
    "severity": "High",
    "testing_type": "Penetration Test",
    "target": "OAuth 2.0 authentication flows",
    "instructions": "1. Initiate the OAuth flow for your own account and capture the authorization URL.\n2. Check if the URL contains a random, non-guessable `state` parameter. If it does not, the flow is vulnerable.\n3. The attack is to send this URL (which links your attacker account) to a victim. When the victim clicks it, they will authorize your account and be logged into it within the application, potentially linking their data to your account."
