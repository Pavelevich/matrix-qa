    "description": "Bypass required steps in a sequential process (e.g., a checkout or registration flow) by navigating directly to a later step's URL.",
    "category": "Business Logic Bypass",
    "severity": "Medium",
    "testing_type": "Penetration Test",
    "target": "Sequential user workflows",
    "instructions": "1. Start a multi-step process, such as an e-commerce checkout (Step 1: Cart, Step 2: Payment, Step 3: Confirmation).\n2. Complete step 1 and proceed to step 2. Capture the URL for step 2.\n3. Open a new browser session, add an item to the cart, but instead of proceeding normally, navigate directly to the captured URL for step 3 (Confirmation).\n4. If the application completes the order without requiring payment, its state machine is flawed. Document the steps to reproduce the bypass."
