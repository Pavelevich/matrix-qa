    "category": "Input Validation Testing",
    "severity": "Critical",
    "testing_type": "Penetration Test",
    "target": "File upload functionality that processes images",
    "instructions": "1. Locate a file upload form that accepts SVGs.\n2. Craft a malicious SVG file with an XXE payload: `<svg><!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \"file:///etc/hostname\">]><text>&xxe;</text></svg>`.\n3. Upload the file. If the rendered image contains the server's hostname, the XML parser is vulnerable. Document the SVG payload."
