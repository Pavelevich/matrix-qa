    "testing_type": "Side-Channel Attack",
    "target": "Endpoints with variable response times",
    "instructions": "1. Identify a feature that responds with different timing based on user data. A search feature is a classic example.\n2. Create a malicious page that uses `fetch` to make a cross-site request to this search feature within a `window.open` popup.\n3. Time the request. For example, search for `?q=admin_a`. If it's faster than `?q=admin_z`, you can infer information character by character.\n4. This is a complex, statistical attack. The goal is to prove that a timing difference exists and can be measured cross-site."
