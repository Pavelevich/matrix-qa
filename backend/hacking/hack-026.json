    "target": "Login forms",
    "instructions": "1. Navigate to the login form.\n2. Attempt to log in with a valid username and an incorrect password five times in a row.\n3. After the fifth attempt, observe the application's response. A robust application should temporarily lock the account or present a CAPTCHA.\n4. If you can continue attempting to log in indefinitely with no mitigation, the form is vulnerable to brute-force or credential stuffing attacks.\n5. Document the login behavior after multiple failed attempts."
