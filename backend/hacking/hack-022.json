    "instructions": "1. Navigate directly to `/.git/config` relative to the website's root URL (e.g., `https://example.com/.git/config`).\n2. If the browser displays or downloads a file containing repository configuration data, the `.git` directory is exposed.\n3. The entire source code can then be reconstructed using tools like `git-dumper`. The initial finding is sufficient proof.\n4. Document the URL and take a screenshot of the exposed `config` file content."
