    "description": "Determine if the application uses WebRTC and if its implementation leaks the user's true internal/external IP address, even when behind a VPN.",
    "category": "Information Disclosure",
    "severity": "Low",
    "testing_type": "Security Assessment",
    "target": "WebRTC implementations",
    "instructions": "1. Navigate the application and look for features using video/audio chat or peer-to-peer connections.\n2. Open the browser console and execute a standard WebRTC STUN request script (many are available online).\n3. The script will create a peer connection and inspect the ICE candidates.\n4. If any of the generated candidates reveal your actual public or private IP address, the application is leaking this information. Document the finding."
