    "description": "Evade Web Application Firewall detection by using character encoding, case variations, comments, and other obfuscation techniques.",
    "category": "Input Validation Testing",
    "severity": "High",
    "testing_type": "Vulnerability Assessment",
    "target": "Web Application Firewalls (WAF)",
    "instructions": "1. Identify an input blocked by the WAF (e.g., `<script>alert(1)</script>`).\n2. Systematically apply obfuscation techniques. Try case variation: `<sCrIpT>`. Try alternative encodings: URL-encode certain characters. Try inserting comments: `<script>`.\n3. For SQLi, use different syntax: `union/**/select` or use alternative functions if the database supports them.\n4. Each time the WAF blocks a payload, try a different variation. If any payload successfully passes the WAF and executes, document the exact payload."
