    "description": "Exploit unsafe dynamic render calls in Ruby on Rails applications to achieve Remote Code Execution.",
    "category": "Remote Code Execution",
    "severity": "Critical",
    "testing_type": "Penetration Test",
    "target": "Ruby on Rails applications",
    "instructions": "1. Find a parameter that appears to be rendered by the server.\n2. Attempt to inject a payload that uses ERB (Embedded Ruby) syntax. Start with a simple probe: `<%= 7*7 %>`.\n3. If the page renders '49', the application is likely vulnerable.\n4. Escalate to an RCE payload: `<%= system('id') %>`. A successful response containing the server user's ID confirms RCE."
